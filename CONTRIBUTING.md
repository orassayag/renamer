Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project. Contributing doesn't just mean submitting pull requests—there are many different ways for you to get involved, including answering questions, reporting issues, improving documentation, or suggesting new features.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request:
1. Check if the issue already exists in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/orassayag/renamer/issues)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Error codes (if applicable)
   - Your environment details (OS, Node version)

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes following the code style guidelines below
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Commit with clear, descriptive messages
6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

### Code Style Guidelines

This project uses:
- **TypeScript** with strict type checking
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **Prettier** for code formatting

Before submitting:
```bash
# Check for linting errors
pnpm lint

# Build to ensure no TypeScript errors
pnpm build

# Test the script
pnpm start
```

### Coding Standards

1. **Functions with 3+ parameters**: Use object parameters with proper types
2. **Error handling**: All errors should include unique error codes in format `(1000XXX)`
3. **JSDoc comments**: Public functions should have JSDoc documentation
4. **Type safety**: Avoid using `any` - define proper types
5. **No comments inside functions**: Keep function bodies clean
6. **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables and functions

### Adding New Features

When adding new features:
1. Create appropriate types in `src/types/`
2. Add logic in `src/logic/` or utilities in `src/utils/`
3. Update validation in `src/logic/validateSettings.ts` if needed
4. Add unique error codes following the existing pattern
5. Update JSDoc comments
6. Test thoroughly with various file patterns

### Error Code Management

When adding new errors:
1. Use the next available error code following the pattern `(1000XXX)`
2. Keep error codes sequential and organized
3. Include the error code at the end of the error message
4. Ensure error messages are clear and actionable
